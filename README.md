Real times Expenses fraud detection using machine learning  

ml project - real time expenses fraud detection using machine learning 

admin login ,  employee login  

employee onboarding form - >   register employee in database 
 

to detect fraud  ->    employees should not exceed  their purchasing power limit ,  for eg - employee with 20k allowances etc limit should not exceed  the limit given to him  ,  also add section where employee logs work & work logs ,  if that work logs & work is not justifying what employee was supposed to do at onboarding then that's a fraud too ,  

employee registration will be completed only  after admin validates him ,  admin reviews onboarding then validates him 


uiux simple good   , dashboard for employees  etc   
                     for admin also   


machine learning implementation is mandatory    

It should be real time    - as we add employees or change employee data eg-via employee login add work logs work that is not justified or claim payment receipts that exceed employee limit    it should analyze & detect fraud dynamically
